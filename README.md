# forward_and_Inverse_kinematics


This task includes the forward and inverse kinematics for a 3-degree-of-freedom robot arm. The kinematics calculations for determining the position of the robot arm.


1- Forward Kinematics calculates the position of the end effector based on the given joint angles.
